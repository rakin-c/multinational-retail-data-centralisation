# Multinational Retail Data Centralisation
## Introduction
For a multinational company selling various goods across the globe, sales data can be stored in many different places, making it inconvenient and difficult for it to be accessed for analysis by current members of the team.

The company desires to make this data more accessible, so this project aims to centralise this data in one location. All the sales data from different sources is collected into one database, which can then be queried to provide up-to-date metrics for business.
